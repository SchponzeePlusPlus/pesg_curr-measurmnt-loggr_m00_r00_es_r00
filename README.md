## Instructions

Before you start opening and modifying files in this repo you should do the following:

1. Install the following programs:
    - Fritzing (V1.0.4)
    - KiCAD
    - LaTeX to PDF Typesetting / Compilation stack
        - MiKTeX + TeXworks (front end) + pdfLaTeX

### Fritzing

X. Import the following parts bin: XXX.fzbz and save the bin (as an .fzb) to a local destination, so that your local instance of Fritzing on a specific computer can access and reference that parts bin. Some of the parts within that parts bin are currently utilised in source files in this repo.
   
    - I recommend the saving the .fzb file in .fritzing/git-ignore-me so that this git repo can gitignore it
      - NOTE: DO NOT SAVE CHANGES TO THE .fzb FILE WITHOUT RE-EXPORTING XXX.fzbz TO SAVE THE CHANGES TO THE REPO
